# Native Android Peer to Peer File Sharing App that works on a Local Area Network (LAN)

# Working Mechanism
The App uses the Network Service Discovery (NSD) Protocol to automatically find and connect to the nearby devices 

# Temporary Notice
The App is still in developmental phase so the app doesn't work in a reliable manner for now, everyone is invited to contribute to this project.
